                    <li><strong>Submit Your Query</strong> - Submit a query with one gene or protein symbol per row in the
                        text box, or upload a text file with one gene or protein symbol per line.
                        KEA3 accepts HGNC-approved gene symbols (but is not case-sensitive) and will discard probe names, transcript IDs,
                        and other unrecognizable IDs that have not been converted to gene symbols. You can
                        use the example gene set available as a link above the submission box to gain
                        familiarity with the expected format. After submitting your query, you will be presented
                        with the results page. Most queries are processed in less than 30 seconds.

                    <li><strong>Navigating Your Results</strong> - Results tables from the integration methods MeanRank and TopRank
                        and from each KEA3 kinase substrate library are accessible from a dropdown menu.
                        The MeanRank table is by default the first table shown because it performed the best across the KEA3 benchmarks. Tables may
                        be searched by entering terms in the search box, sorted by column by clicking on the
                        column header, and copied to the clipboard by clicking on the Copy button. Results
                        for the KEA3 kinase substrate libraries are sorted by the Fisher's Exact Test p-value.
                        This provides a ranking of kinases whose putative substrates
                        are most closely similar to the query set. Integrated results, which take into account
                        results from all libraries, are sorted in ascending order by score. Lower scores indicate
                        more relevancy to the kinase substrate set. The top 100 results are returned for each table. The full kinase ranking and results
                        for each integration method and library may be downloaded as a tab-separated (tsv) file using a link found at the footer of each
                        results table. Full results are also available via the
                        <a href="#content4-z">KEA3 API</a>.

                    <li><strong>Visualizing Your Results</strong> - A global kinase co-expression
                        network, a local results-specific co-regulatory network, bar charts, and a clustergram are
                        available to aid in interpreting the results.

                            <li><strong>Kinase Co-expression Networks</strong></li>

                            The kinase co-expression networks are provided to help users visualize their top ranking kinases
                            in the context of the larger human kinase phosphorylation network. There are three networks generated from GTEx,
                            TCGA, and ARCHS4 expression data. Users may toggle between these three networks using the dropdown menu.

                            The slider above the network designates the number of kinases to highlight in the network. The kinases that are highlighted are the top results
                            from the library that is selected from library selection dropdown menu.
                            Network node coloring options provide additional information about the tissues or tumor types the kinases may be
                            most active in. The network may be zoomed, panned, and saved as an SVG image. There are other options, for
                            example, hiding the legend or switching to full screen. These options can be accessed by clicking
                            the "Network Options" hamburger.

                            <li><strong>Kinase Co-regulatory Networks</strong></li>
                            Kinase-kinase phosphorylation networks are dynamically generated using the top results of the selected library. Edges between kinases are defined
                            by evidence from the KEA3 libraries and are directed where evidence from a KSI library supports the interaction and undirected where evidence from a PPI library supports the interaction.
                            The supporting evidence for each
                            edge is summarized in a tooltip that appears upon hovering over each edge. The slider above the network indicates the number of top kinase results
                            to include in the network from the library results indicated in the library selection dropdown.

                            <li><strong>Bar Charts</strong></li>
                            Bar charts corresponding to the top kinases of the selected library display the -log10(pvalue) for KEA3 kinase substrate library results, and an integrated
                            rank score for the integrated library results. The numer of top kinases on the y-axis may be modifed using the slider.

                            The interactive clustergram shows the overlapping query substrate targets among top library results.
