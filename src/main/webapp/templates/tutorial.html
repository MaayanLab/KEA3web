        <li><strong>Navigating Your Results</strong> - Results tables from the integration methods MeanRank
            and TopRank
            and from each KEA3 kinase substrate library are accessible from a dropdown menu.
            The MeanRank table is by default the first table shown because it performed the best across the
            KEA3 benchmarks. Tables may
            be searched by entering terms in the search box, sorted by column by clicking on the
            column header, and copied to the clipboard by clicking on the Copy button. Results
            for the KEA3 kinase substrate libraries are sorted by the Fisher's Exact Test p-value.
            This provides a ranking of kinases whose putative substrates
            are most closely similar to the query set. Integrated results, which take into account
            results from all libraries, are sorted in ascending order by score. Lower scores indicate
            more relevancy to the kinase substrate set. The top 100 results are returned for each table. The
            full kinase ranking and results
            for each integration method and library may be downloaded as a tab-separated (tsv) file using a
            link found at the footer of each
            results table. Full results are also available via the
            <a href="#api">KEA3 API</a>.
            <img src="static/images/tables.gif" class="img-fluid"></li>
        <li><strong>Visualizing Your Results</strong> - A global kinase co-expression
            network, a local results-specific co-regulatory network, bar charts, and a clustergram are
            available to aid in interpreting the results.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kinase Co-expression Networks</strong></li>

                The kinase co-expression networks are provided to help users visualize their top ranking
                kinases
                in the context of the larger human kinase phosphorylation network. There are three networks
                generated from GTEx,
                TCGA, and ARCHS4 expression data. Users may toggle between these three networks using the
                dropdown menu.
                <img src="static/images/coexp.gif" class="img-fluid">

                The slider above the network designates the number of kinases to highlight in the network.
                The kinases that are highlighted are the top results
                from the library that is selected from library selection dropdown menu.
                Network node coloring options provide additional information about the tissues or tumor
                types the kinases may be
                most active in. The network may be zoomed, panned, and saved as an SVG image. There are
                other options, for
                example, hiding the legend or switching to full screen. These options can be accessed by
                clicking
                the "Network Options" hamburger.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Kinase Co-regulatory Networks</strong></li>
                Kinase-kinase phosphorylation networks are dynamically generated using the top results of
                the selected library. Edges between kinases are defined
                by evidence from the KEA3 libraries and are directed where evidence from a KSI library
                supports the interaction and undirected where evidence from a PPI library supports the
                interaction.
                The supporting evidence for each
                edge is summarized in a tooltip that appears upon hovering over each edge. The slider above
                the network indicates the number of top kinase results
                to include in the network from the library results indicated in the library selection
                dropdown.

                <li><strong>Bar Charts</strong></li>
                Bar charts corresponding to the top kinases of the selected library display the
                -log10(pvalue) for KEA3 kinase substrate library results, and an integrated
                rank score for the integrated library results. The numer of top kinases on the y-axis may be
                modifed using the slider.

                <li>Clustergram</li>
                The interactive clustergram shows the overlapping query substrate targets among top library
                results.
