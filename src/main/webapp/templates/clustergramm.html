    <p>This interactive visualization highlights the relationships between the most common kinase-substrate associations
        detected as overlapping with the input. Each column represents a protein set from a KEA3 library, while the rows
        are putative substrates from the input list which overlap with proteins within each of the KEA3 library sets. 
        Rows and columns can be sorted by sum to observe the KEA3 sets with the most substrates.</p>
